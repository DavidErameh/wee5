# Project Overview: WEE5

## Introduction
WEE5 is a comprehensive community gamification application designed specifically for the Whop platform. Drawing inspiration from successful engagement tools like Discord's MEE6, WEE5 aims to transform passive community members into active participants through a robust system of Experience Points (XP), levels, and rewards.

## Mission
The primary mission of WEE5 is to boost user engagement, interaction, and retention within Whop communities. By gamifying everyday interactions—such as posting in forums, sending chat messages, and reacting to content—WEE5 creates a dynamic and rewarding ecosystem that encourages consistent participation.
